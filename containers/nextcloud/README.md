~~Cron is set as Webcron (couldn't get the Cron version working). Installed OMV anacron and create a weekly job: `wget --spider https://office.kingma.ch/cron.php`
~~

> *75 7-20 * * * /user/bin/wget --spider https://office.kingma.ch-cron.phph Â¦ /user/bin/mail -E -s "Nextcloud nc_cron" "From cronon office.kingma.ch" root > -dev-null 2>&1

No anacrom didn't cut it. Can only do dailies. So cron it is:
Switch on `Cron (Recommended)` in nextcloud admin Basic settings. Create a cron job on `srv-nas-pi` (`crontab -e`) like this:

```sh
*/10 * * * * sudo docker exec -u www-data nextcloud php /var/www/html/cron.php
```
which will start the cron process every 10min on the `nextcloud` container. Check by navigating to `https://office.example.com/settings/admin`.


## logs

Follow nextcloud logs with

```sh
ssh -t srv-nas-pi "sudo docker container logs nextcloud --follow"
```


## get version info

```sh
sudo ./get_nextcloud_version
```
